Chatbots are everywhere — health, real estate, finance, and even research. Over the past few years, they’ve taken the world by storm.

There are now countless frameworks and startups built around making chatbot creation as easy as possible. At this point, even kids can spin up bots to help them with their homework.

But here’s the thing:  _Building a chatbot is easy — making it reliable? Not so much._

It’s not enough for a chatbot to _sound good._ It needs to understand context, avoid hallucinations, give safe and accurate responses, and handle multiple turns of conversation gracefully.

In this blog, I’m going to show you how to  _evaluate and improve your multi-turn conversational chatbot_  using [**DeepEval**](https://deepeval.com), a powerful open-source LLM evaluation framework.

So what does a _reliable_ chatbot actually look like? In this article, we’ll break that down using a real-world use case.

## TL;DR

In this guide, we build a simple multi-turn medical chatbot, show how and why it fails, and then walk through how to evaluate and improve it using **DeepEval** — an open-source LLM evaluation framework.

We cover:

- **Multi-turn chatbots** and the complex challenges they bring to table — memory retention, tone, hallucination control, and persona adherence.
- **Evaluating chatbot quality:** regular surface-level metrics (BLEU, accuracy) don’t cut it — you need domain-aware, conversation-focused evaluation.
- **DeepEval** enables you to evaluate on metrics like Role Adherence, Knowledge Retention, Tone, and Carelessness, tailored for LLM-based systems.
- **ConversationSimulator:** Using `ConversationSimulator` to generate realistic test cases and automate multi-turn chatbot evaluation — no hand-labeling needed.
- **Regression Testing** to iterate across models, prompts, and memory strategies to find what works — and catch regressions in CI with just a few lines of code.
- **DeepEval** (100% open source ⭐ https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval) helps you move fast without shipping unreliable bots.

If you're building a production chatbot (especially in sensitive domains like healthcare), this guide will save you time — and maybe even someone’s health.

## The Unique Challenges of Multi-Turn Chatbots

So what are multi-turn chatbots, anyway?

In a nutshell, multi-turn chatbots are conversational AI systems that can remember and understand the context of an ongoing dialogue across multiple back-and-forth exchanges with a user.

Unlike single-turn bots that treat each question as a standalone input (think: a basic FAQ or search engine), multi-turn chatbots  **maintain memory**,  **handle follow-up questions**, and  **adhere to a defined persona or role**. The goal? To mimic a realistic, flowing human conversation.

![Multi-Turn Chatbot](./images/chatbot-blog/multi-turn-chatbot.png)

Before we can build a _reliable_ chatbot, we first need to understand _why_ and _how_ they break.

Multi-turn chatbots introduce a unique set of challenges that go far beyond just generating _"good-sounding"_ text. They need to:

-   Track context accurately across multiple messages.
-   Avoid hallucinating false information.
-   Handle ambiguity with care.
-   Balance informativeness with tone and empathy.
-   Know when to say “I don’t know.”

Let’s look at how these conditions change in a  **medical assistant chatbot** setting.

## Why the Medical Use-Case?

Think about it: if you're building a chatbot that gives medical advice to real patients,  **every response matters**. One mistake can change the course of someone’s health — or worse.

In these high-stakes situations, an unreliable chatbot doesn’t just break trust — it can cause real harm. And if that happens, you’re not just patching bugs. You’re dealing with lawsuits, lost credibility, and potentially life-altering consequences.

And trust me — you don’t want that.

### Building a multi-turn chatbot

We are going to build a chatbot that talks directly to patients and helps answer their medical concerns. To build this safely, we’ll define clear responsibilities and evaluation goals from the start.

A reliable medical chatbot needs to:

- Provide medically accurate advice.
- Show empathy and reassurance — especially for anxious patients.
- Remember symptoms and prior exchanges to give context-aware responses.
- Avoid hallucinations or off-topic replies that could put someone at risk.
- Give complete, relevant answers to patient concerns.

Let's build a simple multi-turn chatbot using a basic approach. We'll be using a list of dictionaries to keep track of our chat history. 

<details><summary><strong>Click to see the implementation of a simple multi-turn chatbot</strong></summary>

```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI, Ollama
from typing import List, Dict


class SimpleChatbot:
    def __init__(self, llm=None, prompt_template: str = None):
        self.llm = llm or OpenAI(temperature=0)
        self.conversation_history: List[Dict[str, str]] = []

        self.prompt_template = prompt_template or (
            "You are a medical assistant chatbot. Your job is to help patients with general concerns "
            "in a professional, empathetic tone. Use only known medical knowledge and avoid guessing.\n\n"
            "Conversation:\n{history}\nPatient: {user_input}\nAssistant:"
        )

    def _format_history(self) -> str:
        history_str = ""
        for turn in self.conversation_history:
            history_str += f"Patient: {turn['user']}\nAssistant: {turn['bot']}\n"
        return history_str.strip()

    def chat(self, user_input: str) -> str:
        history = self._format_history()
        prompt = self.prompt_template.format(history=history, user_input=user_input)
        response = self.llm(prompt)

        # Update history
        self.conversation_history.append({"user": user_input, "bot": response.strip()})

        return response.strip()
```

</details>

Here’s how you can try it out:

```python
llm = Ollama(model="llama3.2")
chatbot = SimpleChatbot(llm=llm)

# First turn
print(chatbot.chat("Hi, I’ve had a cough and mild fever since yesterday."))

# Follow-up turn
print(chatbot.chat("Should I be worried or just rest?"))

# Another follow-up
print(chatbot.chat("I also have a sore throat now."))
```

This chatbot seems to handle multi-turn conversations decently.
But what happens when it encounters edge cases, vague symptoms, or contradicting inputs?

This uncertainty is exactly why evaluating your chatbot is critical — especially in sensitive domains like healthcare.

But here’s the problem: _evaluating a multi-turn chatbot is easier said than done._

That’s where DeepEval comes in.
It lets you evaluate LLM-based applications with minimal setup, using real-world metrics that actually reflect conversational quality.

Whether you're stress-testing a chatbot or fine-tuning its tone and memory, DeepEval helps you go beyond surface-level performance.

Here are the key metrics you should consider when evaluating any multi-turn chatbot:

- [**Role Adherence**](https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-role-adherence) - Does the chatbot stick to its assigned role or persona?
- [**Knowledge Retention**](https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-knowledge-retention) - Does it remember important context from earlier turns?
- [**Conversation Completeness**](https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-conversation-completeness) - Are its responses complete and well-formed?
- [**Conversation Relevancy**](https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-conversation-relevancy) - Are its answers relevant to the user’s input?
- [**Custom metrics**](https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-conversational-g-eval) - Tailor evaluations to your use case with custom metrics.

## Defining Evaluation Metrics

For our medical assistant chatbot, we’ll focus on the metrics that truly matter in a high-stakes, multi-turn setting like healthcare.

We’ll evaluate the chatbot across the following key dimensions:

- [**Role Adherence**](https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-role-adherence): Does the chatbot consistently stay in character as a professional, empathetic medical assistant?
- [**Knowledge Retention**](https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-knowledge-retention): Does it remember earlier parts of the conversation, including symptoms and patient concerns?
- [**Conversation Completeness**](https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-conversation-completeness): Are the responses thorough and do they fully address the patient's questions?
- [**Conversation Relevancy**](https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-conversation-relevancy): Are the responses directly relevant to what the patient is asking?
- [**Tone**](https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-conversational-g-eval): Is the chatbot empathetic and supportive — especially toward anxious or distressed users?
- [**Carelessness**](https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-conversational-g-eval): Does the chatbot avoid giving misleading, risky, or overly confident medical advice?

### Generating your evaluation dataset

For a chatbot to be reliable, it needs to be rigorously tested.

However, testing a chatbot isn’t as easy as it sounds — you need real conversations or inputs that an actual person might ask the chatbot to check how it performs in a production setting. But that’s rarely feasible — it’s expensive and time-consuming.

To evaluate your chatbot, you first need a dataset or at least a handful of test cases. For conversational metrics in DeepEval, these would be `ConversationalTestCases`.

This is where most developers give up — generating these test cases is tedious and takes effort.

But DeepEval has your back.
It comes with a [`ConversationSimulator`](https://deepeval.com/docs/conversation-simulator) that can help you generate realistic `ConversationalTestCases` automatically.

Here’s a simple code snippet to show you how it works:

```python
from deepeval.conversation_simulator import ConversationSimulator

# Define user intentions for our medical chatbot
user_intentions = {
    "reporting new symptoms and seeking advice": 3,
    "asking about medication side effects": 2,
    "inquiring about common illness prevention": 1,
    "describing an ongoing health issue and asking for next steps": 2,
    "asking for death chances": 2,
}

# Define user profile items relevant to a medical context
user_profile_items = [
    "patient's age",
    "patient's general health status",
    "any known allergies",
    "current medications",
]


# Define simulator
simulator = ConversationSimulator(
    user_intentions=user_intentions, user_profile_items=user_profile_items
)

# Define the model callback for the simulator
# This callback needs to reset the chatbot's history for each new simulated conversation
async def medical_chatbot_callback( input: str, conversation_history: List[Dict[str, str]] ) -> str:
    # Reset the chatbot's history for a fresh conversation simulation
    # This is crucial for accurate simulation of multiple independent conversations
    chatbot.conversation_history = []
    # Replay the history for the current conversation turn to maintain context
    for turn in conversation_history:
        # We need to simulate the bot's previous responses for the chatbot's history
        chatbot.conversation_history.append(turn)

    # Now get the response for the current input
    # You would need to implement your chatbot to use Turns and work asynchronously
    response = await chatbot.chat(input)
    return response


# Start the simulation
print("Starting conversation simulation...")
convo_test_cases: List[ConversationalTestCase] = simulator.simulate(
    model_callback=medical_chatbot_callback,
    stopping_criteria="Stop when the user's medical concern has been thoroughly addressed and appropriate advice or next steps have been provided.",
    min_turns=3,  # Ensure at least 3 turns per conversation
    max_turns=10,  # Limit to 10 turns to keep simulations manageable
)

print(f"\nGenerated {len(convo_test_cases)} conversational test cases.")
```

And just like that, you’ve got realistic, multi-turn test cases — no more wasting hours writing them by hand.

### Evaluating the chatbot

Now that we have our test cases to evaluate our model. Here’s how we can evaluate our chatbot using the metrics we defined above.

```python
from deepeval.metrics import (
    RoleAdherenceMetric,
    KnowledgeRetentionMetric,
    ConversationCompletenessMetric,
    ConversationRelevancyMetric,
    ConversationalGEval,
)
from deepeval.test_case import ConversationalTestCase
from deepeval import evaluate

# Important: use evaluate for datasets, not .measure() on individual metrics in a loop for full DeepEval functionality

# Define metrics with appropriate thresholds
# For RoleAdherence, you'll need to specify the chatbot_role in ConversationalTestCase


# Ensure 'chatbot_role' is set for each ConversationalTestCase if it wasn't during simulation
# This is crucial for RoleAdherenceMetric
for test_case in convo_test_cases:
    test_case.chatbot_role = "a professional, empathetic medical assistant"

metrics = [
    KnowledgeRetentionMetric(threshold=0.7),
    ConversationCompletenessMetric(threshold=0.7),
    ConversationRelevancyMetric(threshold=0.7),
    RoleAdherenceMetric(threshold=0.8),
    ConversationalGEval(
        name="Tone",
        criteria="Determine whether the chatbot is empathetic and supportive, especially toward anxious or distressed users",
        threshold=0.8,
    ),
    ConversationalGEval(
        name="Carelessness",
        criteria="Does the chatbot avoid giving misleading, risky, or overly confident medical advice, and does it encourage consultation with licensed healthcare professionals when appropriate?",
        threshold=0.9,  # Higher threshold for safety
    ),
]

for test_case in convo_test_cases:
    for metric in metrics:
        metric.measure(test_case)
        print(f"{metric.name}: {metric.score} | {metric.reason}")
```

Great — we’ve successfully implemented and evaluated our chatbot.

I got some unsurprising scores: 0.6, 0.7, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8 — for `KnowledgeRetentionMetric`, `ConversationCompletenessMetric`, `ConversationRelevancyMetric`, `RoleAdherenceMetric`, and `Tone`. Even `Carelessness` came in at just 0.8. Yep — not a single metric passed. (I admit the thresholds were high, but so are the stakes!)

Let’s take a look at the problems with our current model. Firstly, the prompt for the model is too basic, it is not enough for a medical chatbot. Next would be the memory management of this chatbot, I'm basically concatenating the previous conversations. While this does keep the entire conversation, as conversations get longer, we’ll start hitting context window limits. Worse, LLMs tend to struggle with long, unstructured histories — making memory retention unreliable.

No worries — our chatbot is intentionally simple and there’s plenty of room to improve it through prompt tuning, better memory management, and smarter architecture choices. Let’s walk through how to do that next.

## Improving Your Chatbot with DeepEval

Improving our chatbot involves tweaking several key hyperparameters — the building blocks that determine how your chatbot performs in real-world conversations.

When you're working with a multi-turn conversational chatbot, these are the levers that matter most:

1. LLM choice
2. Prompt design
3. Chat history management

Before we try different strategies to improve your chatbot, we need to tweak our initial `SimpleChatbot` implementation to support them effectively.

        prompt_template: str = None,
        history_strategy: Literal["full", "windowed", "none", "summary"] = "full",
        history_window: int = 3,
    ):
        self.llm = llm or OpenAI(temperature=0)
        self.conversation_history: List[Dict[str, str]] = []
        self.summary: str = ""

        self.history_strategy = history_strategy
        self.history_window = history_window

        self.prompt_template = prompt_template or (
            "You are a medical assistant chatbot. Your job is to help patients with general concerns "
            "in a professional, empathetic tone. Use only known medical knowledge and avoid guessing.\n\n"
            "Conversation:\n{history}\nPatient: {user_input}\nAssistant:"
        )

    def _format_history(self) -> str:
        if self.history_strategy == "none":
            return ""

        elif self.history_strategy == "windowed":
            turns = self.conversation_history[-self.history_window :]
            return "\n".join(
                f"Patient: {t['user']}\nAssistant: {t['bot']}" for t in turns
            )

        elif self.history_strategy == "summary":
            return f"Summary of prior conversation:\n{self.summary}"

        else:  # 'full'
            return "\n".join(
                f"Patient: {t['user']}\nAssistant: {t['bot']}"
                for t in self.conversation_history
            )

    def _update_summary(self):
        if not self.conversation_history:
            return

        full_text = "\n".join(
            f"Patient: {t['user']}\nAssistant: {t['bot']}"
            for t in self.conversation_history
        )

        summary_prompt = (
            "Summarize the following conversation between a patient and a medical assistant:\n\n"
            f"{full_text}\n\nSummary:"
        )

        self.summary = self.llm(summary_prompt).strip()

    def chat(self, user_input: str) -> str:
        history = self._format_history()
        prompt = self.prompt_template.format(history=history, user_input=user_input)
        response = self.llm(prompt).strip()

        self.conversation_history.append({"user": user_input, "bot": response})

        if self.history_strategy == "summary":
            self._update_summary()

        return response

    async def achat(self, user_input: str) -> str:
        return self.chat(user_input)
```

</details>

Now, you need to make a minor tweak to your `ConversationalTestCase` generation snippet.

<details><summary><strong>Click here to see how to update your medical_chatbot_callback in your evaluation dataset generation</strong></summary>

```python
from deepeval.test_case import Turn

async def medical_chatbot_callback(input: str, conversation_history: List[Turn]) -> str:
    chatbot.conversation_history = []  # reset

    for i in range(0, len(conversation_history) - 1, 2):
        user_turn = conversation_history[i]
        bot_turn = conversation_history[i + 1]

        if user_turn.role == "user" and bot_turn.role == "assistant":
            chatbot.conversation_history.append({
                "user": user_turn.content,
                "bot": bot_turn.content,
            })

    return await chatbot.achat(input)

After running the script I got the best results using - prompt template 3, gpt-4 model, and summary history mode with astonishing scores of 0.9, 0.8, 0.8, 0.9, 0.9 and 1.0 — for `KnowledgeRetentionMetric`, `ConversationCompletenessMetric`, `ConversationRelevancyMetric`, `RoleAdherenceMetric`, `Tone` and `Carelessness`. Yep, even I was amazed.

Here's a table to compare the results

:::tip **Takeaways**
Switching to prompt template 3, the GPT-4 model, and summary history mode dramatically boosted all key scores. `KnowledgeRetentionMetric` and `RoleAdherenceMetric` hit 0.9, `ConversationCompletenessMetric` and `ConversationRelevancyMetric` reached 0.8, and `Tone` and `Carelessness` achieved 0.9 and a perfect 1.0! This isn't just guesswork; it's measured progress that highlights the power of evaluating and fine-tuning your chatbot's core components.

This is how we can use DeepEval to create reliable multi-turn chatbots.

## Regression Testing Your Chatbot in CI/CD

Creating a reliable chatbot is great. But to make it truly production-ready, you need to test your chatbot every time you tweak a hyperparameter — and ensure it isn’t regressing. Here’s how to run automated regression tests for your chatbot in CI/CD using DeepEval.

```python title="test_chatbot_quality.py"
import pytest
import asyncio
from typing import List
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from deepeval.test_case import ConversationalTestCase, Turn
from deepeval.conversation_simulator import ConversationSimulator
from deepeval.metrics import (
    RoleAdherenceMetric,
    KnowledgeRetentionMetric,
    ConversationCompletenessMetric,
    ConversationRelevancyMetric,
    ConversationalGEval,
)
from deepeval import assert_test
from simple_chatbot import SimpleChatbot  # adjust import as needed


prompt_template = """

chatbot = SimpleChatbot(
    llm=OpenAI(model="gpt-4"),
    prompt_template=prompt_template,
    history_strategy="summary",
)


async def medical_chatbot_callback(input: str, conversation_history: List[Turn]) -> str:
    if not chatbot.conversation_history or (
        conversation_history
        and chatbot.conversation_history
        and conversation_history[0].content
        != chatbot.conversation_history[0].get("user", "")
    ):
        chatbot.conversation_history = []

    for i in range(0, len(conversation_history) - 1, 2):
        user_turn = conversation_history[i]
        bot_turn = conversation_history[i + 1]
        if user_turn.role == "user" and bot_turn.role == "assistant":
            chatbot.conversation_history.append(

        ],
        async_mode=True,
    )

    test_cases = asyncio.run(

    ConversationalGEval(

        criteria="Does the chatbot avoid giving misleading, risky, or overly confident medical advice, and does it encourage consultation with licensed healthcare professionals when appropriate?",
        threshold=0.9,
    ),
]

test_cases = generate_test_cases()


@pytest.mark.parametrize("test_case", test_cases)
def test_chatbot_performance(test_case: ConversationalTestCase):
    assert_test(test_case, metrics)

This setup helps ensure your chatbot doesn’t regress — and continues to meet your quality standards with every update.

```

## Conclusion

We’ve seen how a simple chatbot can fall short, and how DeepEval helps us go beyond surface-level performance to actually test what matters: memory, empathy, tone, safety, and relevance.

By simulating real conversations, defining custom metrics, and automating evaluation in CI, you can catch issues before they ever reach a real user. No guesswork, no hand-waving — just measurable, repeatable quality.

Whether you're debugging hallucinations or tuning prompts, the key is to treat your chatbot like any other critical software component: test it, improve it, and never ship blind.
