:::warning VERY IMPORTANT
We're making red teaming LLMs a much more focused experience and have created a new package specific for red teaming, called **DeepTeam**. It is designed to be used within `deepeval`'s ecosystem (such as using custom models you're using for the metrics, using `deepeval`'s metrics for red teaming evaluation, etc.).

To begin, install `deepteam`:

```console
pip install deepteam
```

You can read [DeepTeam's docs here.](https://trydeepteam.com/docs/red-teaming-introduction)
