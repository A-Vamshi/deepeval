Learn how to build and evaluate a reliable **LLM-powered medical chatbot** using **OpenAI**, **LangChain**, **Qdrant**, and **DeepEval**—from development to deployment.

:::note
If you are working with **multi-turn chatbots**, this tutorial will be helpful to you. We will go through the entire process of building a reliable _multi-turn chatbot_ and how to evaluate it using `deepeval`
:::

## Overview

DeepEval is an open-source LLM evaluation framework that supports a wide-range of metrics to help evaluate and iterate on your LLM applications.

In this tutorial, we'll be building a reliable medical chatbot using **OpenAI**, **Qdrant**, **LangChain** and **DeepEval**.

## What You'll Learn

In this tutorial, you'll be learning:

- How to build a medical chatbot
- How to define evaluation criteria for a chatbot
- How to simulate conversations using `deepeval`
- How to evaluate and improve your chatbot
- How to do component level evals on your chatbot

## Medical Chatbot

Multi-turn chatbots are increasingly common across industries like healthcare and finance. Their ability to maintain context and provide personalized support makes them powerful tools.

In this tutorial, you'll build a reliable **medical chatbot** that can answer user queries, diagnose symptoms, and book appointments. It's a **multi-turn conversational agent**—meaning it can remember previous messages, handle follow-up questions, and take action based on the full conversation.

To ensure quality, you'll test the chatbot using `deepeval`'s [`ConversationSimulator`](https://deepeval.com/docs/conversation-simulator), which mimics real user interactions and generates [`ConversationalTestCase`](https://deepeval.com/docs/evaluation-multiturn-test-cases)s to validate the bot's performance.

Here's what the chatbot interface looks like:

The chatbot takes user input, tracks context across turns, and responds accordingly—all within an intuitive, user-friendly interface.

In the next sections, you'll build and evaluate a chatbot that can carry out full medical conversations and schedule appointments based on user symptoms.
