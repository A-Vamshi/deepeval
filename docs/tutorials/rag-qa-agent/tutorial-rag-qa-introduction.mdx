This tutorial walks you through the entire process of building a reliable **RAG (_Retrieval-Augmented Generation_) QA Agent**, 
from initial development to iterative improvement through `deepeval`'s evaluations.

:::note
This tutorial focuses on building a RAG-based QA agent for an infamous company called **Theranos**. However, the concepts and practices used throughout this tutorial are applicable to any **RAG-based application**. If you are working with RAG applications, this tutorial will be helpful to you.

## Overview

DeepEval is an open-source LLM evaluation framework that supports a wide-range of metrics to help evaluate and iterate on your LLM applications.

In this tutorial, we'll be building a reliable RAG QA Agent using **OpenAI**, **LangChain** and **DeepEval**.

## What You'll Learn

In this tutorial you'll learn:

- How to build a RAG QA agent.
- How to define evaluation criteria for your RAG agent.
- How to generate synthetic evaluation datasets to test your RAG agent.
- How to evaluate and improve your RAG agent using `deepeval`.
- How to prepare your RAG agent for deployment.

## RAG QA Agent

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** agents are a widely adopted pattern that let companies build domain-specific assistants without the need to fine-tune large models.

In this tutorial, you'll build a **RAG QA agent** designed to answer questions about **Theranos**, a company focused on blood diagnostics. The agent takes a user query as input and returns an answer based on the most relevant documents stored in a vector database.

The goal is to create a reliable system that provides accurate, relevant answers strictly grounded in retrieved content â€” avoiding hallucinations or unsupported claims.

**Theranos** is using a RAG QA agent to help users understand its services and technology. Here's what thier QA Agent looks like:

The agent retrieves relevant context, answers based strictly on that content, and cites its sources. If no relevant documents are found, it simply informs the user.

In the following sections of this tutorial, you'll learn how to build a reliable RAG QA Agent that retrieves correct data and generates an 
accurate answer based on the retrieved context.
