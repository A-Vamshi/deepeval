This tutorial walks you through the entire process of building a reliable **RAG (_Retrieval-Augmented Generation_) QA Agent**, 
from initial development to iterative improvement through `deepeval`'s evaluations.

:::note
If you're working with RAG applications, this tutorial will be helpful to you. While this tutorial focuses on a QA agent for a company 
called **Theranos**, the concepts and practices used throughout this tutorial are applicable to any **RAG-based application**.

## What You'll Learn:

In this tutorial you'll learn:

- How to build a RAG agent.
- How to define evaluation criteria for your RAG agent.
- How to generate synthetic evaluation datasets to test your RAG agent.
- How to evaluate and improve your RAG agent using `deepeval`.
- How to prepare your RAG agent for deployment.

## RAG QA Agent

Throughout this tutorial, we'll build a RAG QA agent designed to answer questions about **Theranos**, a company specializing in blood 
diagnostics. The QA agent we'll build retrieves relevant data from the company's knowledge base based on a user's query. 
It takes the query as `input` and generates a response that answers the query from the most relevant documents in the knowledge base.

Your objective is to build a reliable RAG QA agent that not only answers the user's queries but also makes sure that the answers 
are **relevant and correct** based on the information in the knowledge base. If the relevant documents are not found, the agent must 
respond that _there are no documents relevant to the user's query_ instead of hallucinating or speculating a possible answer, 
which would make it unreliable.

## What You'll build

With AI agents on the rise, RAG agents have particularly become the most commonly used AI agents now. This is because RAGs provide the 
flexibility to make an AI answer questions related to a specific topic that might be private by using retrieval methods to access this 
private information from a knowledge base. This allows companies to escape the hassle of fine-tuning an entire AI application on their 
database; instead, they can simply use a RAG agent.

Companies now use RAG agents to provide customers and employees with information about their company in a much more accessible and 
flexible way. **Theranos** has also decided to use a RAG agent to answer the queries a user might have about their company and how they 
diagnose blood. 

Here's what **Theranos**'s RAG QA agent looks like:

The image above shows a QA agent in action â€” it takes a question as `input` and generates a relevant answer based on the retrieved context.
The answer must absolutely be related to a context from the knowledge base, or it shouldn't answer the question and just explain 
that there are no documents relevant to the user's query.

In the following sections of this tutorial, you'll learn how to build a reliable RAG QA Agent that retrieves correct data and generates an 
accurate answer based on the retrieved context.
